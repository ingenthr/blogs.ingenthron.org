title: "It's not COVID-19"

Meta-note: I'm writing this mostly for posterity.  At the moment, I
think I'll only post it once I have a positive test.  I do not have
one, more on that in a moment.

TL;DR: 

* As I mentioned to some people, my doctor diagnosed me with COVID-19,
  but that initial diagnosis didn't pan out with further testing (both
  RT-PCR and Serological).  Not sure what I have. yet.
* If you think you may have it, take your temperature. I should have
  done this sooner.  Oral low grade
  is rougly 99F up 100.9.  CDC calls it a fever at 100.4F.
* Testing, in my experience, was somewhat easy to find but 
  was possibly mishandled (my doctor thinks so), making it pretty much
  useless.
* If you're going to get a nasopharyngeal test, [read the CDC info on
  collecting it](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/lab/guidelines-clinical-specimens.html).
  The field instruction given is short and doesn't always match.


What I am calling day 0, July 4, 2020, I had some lower GI issues,
(diarrhea).  Since I'd eaten some questionable food that day, but felt
odd before even eating it, I wondered if it was food poisoning.  I
just took it easy on my GI system and tried to turn in early.  

On day 1 (July 5 2020), I began to have "flu like symptoms" along with some
lower GI issues.  Since I've not been doing anything particularly
risky, of course I thought it was likely food poisoning.  Doing what
one is supposed to do, I self isolated in a guest room away from
Michelle (my wife) and Josephine (our daughter).  More specifically, I
felt like my skin was crawly and I felt warm.  I had muscle aches and
lesser though continued lower GI issues.

I forced myself to take a walk on day 2, hoping that moving about
would make me feel better.  It did not help.  Still just fever and
achyness though.

The couple days
isolating were not great.  Partially the illness, and partially that I am
not used to sleeping on the hard futon we have in that room.  It's
always comfortable at first, but loses comfort over time.  I did not
take my temperature then, but should have.  I am guessing I would have
noticed a fever.

By the night of day 3, I thought I was getting back to normal and
since I had not developed any respiratory symptoms, I did not think it
was COVID-19.  So, I moved back into our regular bedroom.

In retrospect, something odd happened between day 3 and 4.  I woke up
at 3am with a horrible headache.  I got up, drank a bunch of water,
and took a Tylenol, eventually getting back to sleep.  The reason I
mention this is I felt pretty good on day 4's morning.  In retrospect,
I think it was the Tylenol putting the fever I had (but wasn't
measuring!) at bay.  I also noticed on day 4 that I had very dark
urine-- seemingly nearly brown in color to me.

Since I was on vacation and we hadn't done
anything, we took this day to go to Huntington State Beach.  It's a
bit more isolated than the city beach, gives you a lot more room
between people.  We staked out a
spot pretty far from everyone, Josephine took her nap at the beach and
I even went for a run and got a sunburn on my back-- a dumb move to
not have somone apply sunscreen there for me.

On both day 5 and 6, I was trying to get up early to take care of
Josephine to give Michelle a break.  Both of these days I felt odd
first thing in the morning.  In particular what I noticed was getting
chills and even shivers, though it was 78F/25.5C in the house (looked
at the thermostat going down to get some milk for Josephine.  On day
6, I ended up going back to bed because I just didn't feel well (and
Michelle offered).  I did a couple of errands that day.  Some shopping
for bike tubes (I'd hoped to take Josephine on some rides during
vacation)  and things we needed.  The evening of day 6, a Friday night, just wasn't
any better.  We tried to sit out in the backyard, something that would
normally feel really comfortable to me this time of year, but I just
felt odd.  For example, one really odd symptom was that the back of my
eyesockets hurt.  It was just unusual in the way it felt.  Moving my
head around, it was like I could distinctly feel the pain on the back
of the eye sockets.

I tried to rest up on day 7, since one day this weekend we were to
help Michelle's cousin  put in some curtains.  We did that on day 8.
I still didn't feel "right".  Later that evening while we were home
and talking about how I still didn't feel well, I finally for the
first time took my temperature.  It registered as a 99.7F if I recall
correctly.  I was immediately a bit disappointed in myself because
this meant I probbably had an infection this whole time, exposing
Michelle and Josephine to it, among others.  We talked through it a
bit and decided that it would be best that I isolate at my mother's
house, since Michelle is at high risk and it's really hard to explain
to a 2yo why you can't play with them.  And set an appointment with
the doctor.

On the afternoon of day 8 (a Monday), where I worked remotely from
Mom's house, in the afternoon as in most afternoons previously I began
feeling sick.  Sure enough, 99.7F temperature that rose a little more
into the afternoon.  Earlier in the morning, I'd set an appointment
with the doctor for the next day as a tele-health appointment.  The
staff was ready with some numbers for me to be tested, but I wanted to
talk to the doctor first as I'd had no respiratory symptoms.  I wasn't
sure if a nasopharyngeal test would work.

Day 9 I felt a little worse than the day previous.  I still had chills
and my temps were in the high 99s, eventually going to 100.6F in the
evening.  I spoke with the doctor this day.

The doctor said the symptoms I had sounded a lot like the COVID-19
cases he had seen.  He said many started with GI.  He asked some
questions to eliminate other things such as a UTI and an ear
infection.  He said it sounded like COVID-19 and suggested that I be
tested.  I asked whether this test would be effective if I didn't have
virus in the respiroatory system, and he said it would still typically
test positive.  

So, I set about trying to obtain a test.  

There isn't a very unified
way to find a test.  As a patient, they give you several phone numbers
and you check with them to find an appointment.  My first check was
with what the doctor's office called "the State".  This is done by
OptumServe, which may be administered or also known as LHI.  When you
call the number from the doctor's office, the recording tells you that
this phone number is only for people who do not have internet access.
If you have internet access, go to some URL.  I forget specifically
what they said it was, but it ultimately was the site at
lhi.care/covidtesting.  

After answering where I was and  a questionnaire verifying I was
someone who should be tested, it looked like the next test opening
within 100 miles was 8 days later (July 22).  Not very positive.  I
signed up for it just in case.

Michelle, meanwhile, checked with CVS via the phone and wasn't fairing
much better.  I checked their website at some point.  The worst
website award goes to CVS.  You pull up with a location a list of
places, then you have to click on each one individually to see if they
have test appointments, usually to find they have none.  It's the kind
of UI one would write if you want to rate limit your users.

I decided to go to the state website, which indicated ProjectBaseline
and Verity were also doing testing.  After filling out some similar
questions on that site (which is quite well done, Verity is an
Alphabet company and you can see they use a lot of the material design
elements), I did a similar search.  Initially, it was also pretty
disappointing.  But, after extending the search out from 25 to 50
miles, I found a spot in my county some 38 miles away and only two
days later.  Checking with the doctor's office that this was a
suitable test, I didn't quite feel up to scouring everything else.  I
went to rest knowing that I had a spot for a test.


On day 10, to be able to work in some important meetings that day, I 
took some Tylenol early in the morning.  For me, whenver I take
Tylenol, my internal thermostat would adjust and then I'd spend an
hour or more transitioning to feeling better, but also sweating a lot
as my body temp tries to adjust.  It was not fun.

I handled my meetings, and then as my temp went up in the afternoon,
I was back in the mid 99s.  

One side note on Tylenol.  My wife and mother kept telling me to take
it regularly.  I had previously read an article on the
[Mayo Clinic website](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fever/in-depth/fever/art-20050997)
which indicated that one shouldn't take any meds until a fever of
102F.  There were some other articles positing that fever helped the
body with what it needed to do in order to fight the infection.  My
mom sent over a
[New York Times column](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/well/live/fever-infection-drugs-tylenol-acetaminophen-ibuprofen-advil-aspirin.html?smid=em-share)
that suggested it's fine to treat a fever, citing two studies.  One
was inpatients with sepsis (from 1997), the other was inpatients with critical
care (from 2015).

Okay, so now I needed to really research it.  After refining the
search terms on for [scholar.google.com](scholar.google.com) to
"antipyretic therapy in adults with febrile symptoms as outpatients
prolong illness", not initially knowing "antipyretic" (e.g. Tylenol
and Advil), or "febrile" (effectively, feverish), I turned up a couple
of studies that seemed more like my case.  

One was in the Journal of Clinical Nursing,
[Literature review: should antipyretic therapies routinely be administered to patients with fever?](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03258.x).
The key quote here is:

> Results. Results were inconsistent. None of the studies found that
> antipyretic therapies reduced duration of illness in patients with
> fever. Evidence suggests that antipyretic therapies do not reduce
> the duration of illness, but can prolong it.

The second one was not as applicable to my situation.  According to
[The Effect of Antipyretic Therapy upon Outcomes in Critically Ill Patients: A Randomized, Prospective Study](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/sur.2005.6.369)

> Conclusions: Aggressively treating fever in critically ill patients may lead to a higher mortality rate.

I know my wife and mother were just trying to get me to feel better
and thought Tylenol wouldn't matter.  For me it mattered because it
might prolong the illness and the main way I could tell I was still
fighting an infection was my higher body temperature.

Day 11, testing day.  Felt tired and weird in the morning, but not
many symptoms, including no real fever first thing.  Drove the 38
miles to the test, noticing that I kind of "liked" not having the A/C
running in the car much.  That's odd, since the test time was 11:30a
and it is late July.  The car, sitting in the sun, got quite hot.  

The test collection itself went okay.  I thought I was at the wrong
place at first as there was no massive line for testing or anything to
speak of.  It was a Rite-Aid drive through.  There were 2 cars in
front of me.  I think, based on what I saw, one did a COVID-19 test
and the other was just picking up meds.  

Collecting the sample was a bit uncomfortable, watery eyes and all.  I
had a bit of a runny/stuffy nose that day.  One thing I neglected to
ask the pharmacist was if I should blow my nose first.  It turns out
the answer is yes (I looked later), but I didn't do that.  I swabbed,
stuck it in the tube, passed it through the little drawer, and that
was it.  I forgot to record any labels from the tube so I could follow
details.  There were no literature handouts.

Still felt odd and not all there.  Stalled the car on the way out of
the drive through.  Not normal for me.  

Later that evening I was back into the 100s.  I hit 100.9F just before
going to sleep.

I should also mention that with a little handheld pulseox from my mom,
I noticed my heartrate was higher than is normal for me.  At rest,
sometimes laying there for an hour, I'd be in the low 80s.  If I went
up the stairs and immediately checked, it'd be closer to 95.  

The o2 component I trust a little less on this device.  I would
occasionally see low 90s and in some cases, it would drop below 90 and
alert me.  To check if it was working in a reasonable way, I'd take
some deep breaths and it would go back up.

Day 12 started with a fever and a headache.  This was not good, as
most days were "good" in the morning and would get worse over the
course of the day.  Luckily, the fever dropped a bit and I worked a
bit.  But, by the evening, I was back up into the 100s and feeling
crappy.

Day 13 was a Saturday.  With no work meetings, I planned to sleep in.
It didn't start off well.  Waking up, I was at 99.1F.  It went up a
little bit as I got up and did the normal hygiene stuff.  I hung
around in the mid 99s most of the day.  Finally feeling crappy around
5p, I crawled into bed.  What struck me was the room was quite warm,
probably lower 80s, but my feet were freezing cold.  I alternated my
feet on my calves trying to warm them up under the blankets.  Very
odd.  After lying there for 90 minutes or so, I was at 101.2, still
feeling like I had cold feet under the covers.

Day 14 was originally the day I was hoping to go home.  Nearly a week
earlier I didn't feel too bad and thought I just needed a couple more
days before I could do three days of no-symptom quarantine.  It didn't
work out that way.  I started the day feeling like crap and having a
99.6F.  I'm not sure why, perhaps I was just tired of feeling like
crap, but this day I took some Tylenol in the afternoon so I could
hopefully sit in the backyard and maybe walk around a little.  I was a
bit tired of the bed and quarantine room.  That worked, temp dropped
to 98.4.  Oddly though, I was super tired.  

I noticed this two other days when I took Tylenol.  It seemed like
whenever I took it, my heart rate would drop, my fever would drop, but
I would be super-tired.  It's almost like my body was fighting the
infection all of the time, but if it could take a break and lower the
heartrate/temperature, it realized how tired it was.  Sort of sleepy
tired, but more just physically exhaused.  

Day ended at a 101.8.  Luckily, I took the time to send an email
somewhere in there that if I didn't show up in the morning, it was
because I was not feeling very well.

So much for going home!

Day 15 was more of settling into this new fever-all-day routine.  I
started the day at 99.4.  I did not do much other than rest this day.
Slightly concerning, around 8pm, I checked my o2 and it was 89.  Did
this mean the respiratory symptoms were catching up with me?  That's
where things get dangerous.   I did have some other oddities like my
voice was not working.  It was almost like I was slightly hoarse after
yelling.  

After a few deep breaths, it was was back up to 97. 

Temperature this day hit 101.9F just before bundling up to sleep.

Day 16, had some work things that I needed to get done, so I took a
Tylenol early in the morning at about 7am after measuring my temp at
100.1. I went through the sweating thing, etc.  I
did have a loose BM that morning again.  

I was functional most of the day.  But this day more than others, I
noticed the exhaustion.  It was like when I was under the fever, I
couldn't tell how tired I was because of the elevated heartrate.  It
was hard to focus with this other symptom of exhaustion.  

As the Tylenol wore off at the end of the day, around 7:30pm, my skin
started feeling creepy crawly and by 8pm, I was back to 100.7F, ending
the day earlyish at a 101.4.  Or, so I thought…

This evening, even though I was tired in the morning after taking the
Tylenol, I could not sleep.  It semed to me like my heartrate just
kept up.  I also noticed something new.  Pulsitile Tinnitus.  I'd
never heard of it before, but in my right ear I could hear blood
wooshing along with my heartbeat.  Terribly annoying.

After lying there barely sleeping most of the night and knowing that I
needed to do a presentation the next day, I took some Tylenol at
3:40am.  After sweating it off, I slept a bit.  It was not easy, as I
was in a pool of sweat and I couldn't regulate my temperature very
well.  It worked though as moving to…

Day 17, starting on Tylenol I had a 96.5F temp.  Felt okay, other than
this extreme exhaustion.  I even tried to nap at one point in the
mid-afternoon, but I couldn't get to sleep.  Temp then was still a
reasonable 97.5F.  

Of course, as the Tylenol wore off, I could feel it escalating again.
Again, rather odd symptoms.  A bit of my belly was exposed as I sat in
the bed, and that part that was exposed to the air was freezing.  And
the Pulsetile Tinnitus came back off and on.  Ended the day early at a
100.2 and thankfully slept better that evening.

Day 18, woke up at 7:10am a bit sweaty with more of the tinnitus.
Temp was 98.7F.  Maybe the fever had broken? This morning I had a
bit more mucus.  Nope, after a shower and checking 40 minutes later, I
felt like crap and was back up to 99.7F.  Ended the day with a 99.7F.

Day 19 was finally a bit different.  98.6F in the morning.  Was this
the first day of three with no symptoms so I could return home?!?

All morning, did pretty well.  Just really tired.  I hit a 99.1 later
in the day writing a note to myself "Doing better today", and
closed the day out at 98.8.

Day 20, another Saturday.  Finally feeeling like the fever is gone.
Just tired.  Temps were in 98.8-97.5 range this day.  I was mostly
able to rest since I didn't feel compelled to work.

Day 21, going home day?  Originally the CDC guidelines called for
three days without symptoms before returning home.  A few days earlier
they made that a little less draconian, it is now
"[At least 24 hours with no fever without fever-reducing medication *and* symptoms have improved](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html)"
as of July 16.  I was satisfied the new rules, but didn't quite meet
the three days rule.  We talked thorugh it and figured it was good
enough.  

I returned home, but was really exhausted that day.  We went for a
walk in the neighborhood in the morning and another one in the
evening.  I still felt compelled to lie down to rest.  In one
instance, I wasn't able to sleep, but I was just so exhausted.

Day 22, first day back at normal-ish home/work.  Mostly a normal day,
except I feel drained.  I didn't sleep super well, waking up at 3am,
4am, 5am, 5:15am, etc.  This day I got up early to go to Q

Some GI issues returned.  It was pretty bad overnight, and I recorded
my highest fever at 101.8 overnight.  I know that could be worse, but I had
significant trouble sleeping.  As usual, I was hoping I'd feel good in
the morning and be able to return to work, but could not.  Had a 99.4
at 7:30a and a 99:9 at 11a.  Back of eyeballs hurt again.  Odd
symptom, left calf hurt a lot.  It hurt to walk.  But after sitting outside for a while,
that pain went away.
