Recently, my home compact fluorescent lamps have been dying.  Other than
the trouble of needing to recycle them properly, I've also taken to 
upgrading to LEDs. Despite using all of my Google Search-fu, the basic
answer I came up with is that one needs to test the combinations themselves.

So, I've ordered three different sets of retrofit lights to work with
my new GE ZWave switches.  I'll test them first with the incandescent
dimmer from Leviton, then test again with the GE Dimmer.

The three are a Lithonia P series, a Phillips, and a Lithonia E series.
Based on C|Net reviews, I was going to try a GE one too, but there are no
good LED retrofits for them.

My (rough) testing method consists of a camera and shots of another
incandescent on the same circuit as the LED lamps.  I'm doing all of the
shots at night, with the camera on a tripod in the same place.

I'll post again with some photos when I've finished the shots.
