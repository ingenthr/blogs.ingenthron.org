Matt Ingenthron is a software developer, development manager and a veteran of both 
large and small companies.  He is one of the *Founders Club* at

they had learned from the Open Source memcached project.  In 2010, the company then
known as Membase, merged with CouchOne to become Couchbase.

Currently at Couchbase, Matt is a Senior Director in the Engineering organization
where he primarily leads the SDK and Connector engineering among other projects
related to the further development of Couchbase as a distributed database platform.

Prior to this most recent startup, Matt held a variety of positions at Sun
Microsystems.  His last position there was as a *Principal Engineer* in a global team
focused on engaging large web deployments with Sun's tech.  Before that, Matt was 
part of the field Software Organization assisting with both Sales and 
Professional Services sales and delivery with Web and Identity management
software.  He joined Sun early in 2000 as a Systems Engineer.

resided there since late 2009.
